# Analyzing-traffic-crash-data
This repository contains code that analyses FARS dataset and visualizes interesting correlations between the data using Python
The Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) Dataset is provided by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
The requirement for a traffic accident to be logged into the FARS is that it must result in a fatality within 30 days of the accident.

Throughout our project, our process is to start most of our analysis by visualizing some broad aspects of data and narrowing in on interesting features of the visualizations produced.


We started our analysis by analyzing traffic fatalities per state.
